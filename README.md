# Mobile development training workshop

Hi all, 

This repository contains the work done during the 3 days workshop tailored to introduce newbies into the word of mobile app development with react native. 

Its structured into the various days folder wise
- Day 1 folder has all the work that was done on day 1 (Introduction to mobile app concepts, evolution and javascript basics)
- Day 2 folder has a basic react native app to show how components, props and stylings are being implemented in react native. It ends up with the development of a small character display app for the famous star wars, game of throwns and avengers infinity war movies
- Day 3 folder goes deeper into using props, states, custom components. At the end, we have a todo app that permits a user to add a list of todo items, view them and delete.
